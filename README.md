# Durgans-Hitbox-System
 App + PNG images for displaying hitbox and frame data for SSBM.

This is a very old project of mine (one of my first forays into Melee hacking), inspired by an old frames project called Seanson's Hitbox System. This is just a skeletal outline of my files on this project and not everything here is functional yet, but I should be fixing it up soon.

The app supports frame-by-frame advance forward or backward, playback at various speeds (anywhere between 2x and 1/64th speed), scrubbing (in a timeline bar which displays position in time for hitboxes, reflect boxes, invincibility, etc.), displays move info/stats, and more. Using "Comparison Mode" you can even bring up two different moves from different characters and drag them to overlay and position them, so you can look at how different interactions might work.
