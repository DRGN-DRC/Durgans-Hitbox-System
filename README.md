# Durgans-Hitbox-System
 App + PNG images for displaying hitbox and frame data for SSBM.

This is a very old project of mine (one of my first forays into Melee hacking), inspired by an old frames project called Seanson's Hitbox System. This is just a skeletal outline of my files on this project and not everything here is functional yet, but I should be fixing it up soon.
