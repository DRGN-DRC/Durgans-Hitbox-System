			 Setup
			=-----=

   Setup essentially requires 4 components (besides this repo):
	- Python 3
	- libmelee
	- Other dependencies for libmelee
	- Slippi Dolphin (Ishiiruka)

   Be warned that the trickiest part of this is getting libmelee to instal; the rest of setup is easier after that...


 1) Install Python 3. I'm using v3.10.5, but newer versions should also work.

 2) You might need Microsoft Visual C++ v >= 14.0 for the libmelee install, which you can get from the Build Tools here:
    https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/

    You don't need to install all of Visual Studio. After running the installer, 
    on the Workloads tab select "Desktop development with C++", and click install.

    It might help to update your setuptools Python package with "pip install -U setuptools"
    And you could update your pip scripts with "python.exe -m pip install --upgrade pip"

    You might actually be able to get away with installing as little as just these:
        - Static analysis tools
        - VC++ 2017 version _ v_ latest v_ tools
        - Windows 10 SDK

 3) Install libmelee with "pip install melee", along with psutil and PIP ("pip install psutil" and "pip install pillow").

 4) Download and unzip Slippi Dolphin (FM Dolphin a.k.a Ishiiruka). You can find this here:
    https://github.com/project-slippi/Ishiiruka/releases

    (I used version 2.5.1, but newer versions should also work.)

 5) Before running Dolphin, copy the contents of the "Merge with Dolphin Folder" into 
    Dolphin's root folder. This adds Dolphin settings and GALE01.ini for Gecko codes.

 6) Replace the codes found in '[DolphinRootFolder]\Sys\GameSettings' with custom ones from here:
    https://github.com/altf4/slippi-ssbm-asm/blob/libmelee/Output/Netplay/GALE01r2.ini

			 Workflow
			=--------=

 1) Make a copy of a vanilla NTSC 1.02 disc, and open it up in MCM or MMW. Click on the books icon to change 
    the Codes Library to the one included in this repo. Select all of the mods on the Game State and Hitbox Codes 
    tabs, and whatever you want from the Optional tab (I recommend at least "Display Ungrabbable Hurtboxes".
    Hit Save, and copy the filepath to this disc for the next step.

 2) Configure the frame collection script (FrameCollector.py). Open it in a text editor and scroll down a bit,
    (to about line 51). Set the "dolphinExePath" to the Slippi Dolphin build you downloaded, and "discPath" to
    the disc you modified in step 1. You'll also find a few True/False variables you can change here. Most of 
    these you can leave alone. If you'd like to select a specific set of characters and/or moves to collect, 
    set "collectAllCharacters" and/or "collectAllMoves" to False. And then select the characters and moves 
    you do want to collect in the "charsToCollect" dictionary and the 'Move' enumumeration object below that.

 3) Run the collector script. (e.g. "python.exe TheCollector.py")
   




			=---------------=
			 Troubleshooting
			=---------------=

I haven't tested the optional 'Orthographic Stage Camera' code yet; it might conflict with the 
CM9 (Camera Mode 9) codes.

The Dolphin settings should be configured by default, since the Collector script should be using 
the Dolphin User Folder in this directory. This does currently assume your screen resolution is 
1920x1080 (the target screenshot dimensions if you're collecting frames for the DHS. If your 
resolution is higher, you may be able to use a newer build of Dolphin and play with the graphics 
options to get the correct screenshot resolution. Please let me know how it goes if you try this.
If your display resolution is lower, the 1920x1080 option may not even appear in Dolphin's options.

If you're not able to get your Dolphin screenshots to come out at the correct resolution, 
double-check that your Dolphin settings are being set to those described in this repo's User folder.
	  
You don't really need to set player 4's controls in "Dolphin GCPad Configuration" (unless you 
want to be able to manually control things outside of the TAS windows, e.g. keyboard/controller).
Also, if you want to use a controller for P1 input, go to Controllers -> Configure (for Port 1)
-> select your adapter/port in the Device dropdown (e.g. DInput/0/USB GamePad) ->
Select "GC Controller" in the Profile dropdown, and click "Load". This configuration is included 
in the [Dolphin Folder]\User\Config\Profiles\GCPad folder. It may not work with your controller
adapter (I haven't tested any besides my own).

Ensure Dolphin's Hotkey setting for Frame Advance is set to F11.
You can do this under 'Options -> Hotkey Settings'
