			 Setup
			=-----=

1) Install AutoHotKey (https://www.autohotkey.com/download/)
   I believe v1.1.14.3 was originally used, but later versions might also be fine.

2) Download/install Dolphin 5.0-5491: https://dolphin-emu.org/download/

3) Before running Dolphin, copy the contents of the "Merge with Dolphin Folder" into 
   Dolphin's root folder. This adds Dolphin settings, GALE01.ini for Gecko codes, 
   and "portable.txt". The portable.txt file will tell it to create its user 
   folders in the same Dolphin root directory, rather than in your Documents folder.

   Be sure that the Dolphin folder is not named the same as the program window.

4) Open the "commonFunctions.ahk" file in a text editor and edit the first two 
   lines (dolphinDirectory and dolphinWindowName) to match your Dolphin install.

5) Open the "The Ripper.ahk" script in a text editor and edit the 'sourceFolder' and 
   'destinationFolder' variables to correspond to your Dolphin screenshot's folder 
   and where you would like to output the collected frames.

6) From the Dolphin root folder, open \Sys\GameSettings, and rename or delete
   the "GALE01r2.ini" file.

7) Test that Dolphin is now dumping screenshots at the correct resolution, 1920x1080.
   If it's not, see the troubleshooting section at the bottom of this file.

			 Workflow
			=--------=

	Using the ACS MEM (Automatic Camera Setup - Memory Edit Method) script:

0) Program states:

	- Leave Dolphin not running to start.

   Savestate state; Have Dolphin's savestate 1 configured as follows:
		(Set in this order for convenience)

	- Debug Mode enabled
	- Game at Standard CSS, with:
		P1 (target char) selected as HMN
		P4 (as Falcon) selected as HMN

   Once these things are ready, you may proceed to the steps below.


1) Run "ACS MEM.ahk", and press Ctrl + Shift + ` (tild) to load the emulator and game.


2) Choose the character to gather frames for.


3) Press Ctrl + Shift + 1 to start the match and set the camera.


4) Configure "The Ripper.ahk". Open it in a text editor and scroll down 
   to (or search for) the "Capture List". Uncomment out the moves you want 
   to capture. (Comment out the ones you don't.)


5) Run "The Ripper.ahk" via 'Ctrl + Shift + r'. This should take screenshots for each frame, 
   and after each move is complete, rename the screenshots and place them into a new folder

			 Troubleshooting
			=---------------=

The Dolphin settings configured by default (installed by step 3 of Setup) assume you're using a
monitor with 1920x1080 resolution. If your resolution is higher, you may be able to use a newer
build of Dolphin and play with the graphics options to get the correct screenshot resolution.
If your display resolution is lower, the 1920x1080 option may not even appear in Dolphin's options.

If you're not able to get your Dolphin screenshots to come out at the correct resolution, 
double-check that your Dolphin settings are as follows:

   Set these graphics settings in Dolphin:

	Under the General tab:
	 - Direct3D11
	 - Fullscreen resolution: 1920x1080
	 - Aspect Ratio: Force 16:9
	 - Check "Use Fullscreen"
	 - Auto adjust Window Size is checked, with all other check boxes left unchecked

	Under the Enhancements tab: 
	 - 3x Native internal resolution
	 - Anti-Aliasing at 8x SSAA
	 - Anisotropic Filtering @ 4x
	 - Check "Scaled EFB", "Widescreen Hack, and "Force 24-bit Color" (all else unchecked)

   Set these general settings in Dolphin (via Config button or Options -> Configure...):
	- Under General tab: check "Enable Cheats"
	- Under Interface tab: uncheck "Confirm on Stop"
	- Under Gamecube tab: set Port 4 to "Standard Controller"
	  
   You don't really need to set player 4's controls in "Dolphin GCPad Configuration" (unless you 
   want to be able to manually control things outside of the TAS windows, e.g. keyboard/controller).
   Also, if you want to use a controller for P1 input, go to Controllers -> Configure (for Port 1)
   -> select your adapter/port in the Device dropdown (e.g. DInput/0/USB GamePad) ->
   Select "GC Controller" in the Profile dropdown, and click "Load". This configuration is included 
   in the [Dolphin Folder]\User\Config\Profiles\GCPad folder. It may not work with your controller
   adapter (I haven't tested any besides my own).

   Go to Options -> Hotkey Settings, and Frame Advance to F11.


The game state may be modified, but it is essentially set like so:

$Default Game Settings (No-Limit Time matches, Stage is DL) [DRGN]
	- Time match with no time limit (endless KO fest, no items)
	- Stage select set to random
	- Dreamland only available stage for random select


I've changed many parts of the process and recently re-written this setup guide, 
so some of these steps (or functions in the Ripper) may need some adjustment to 
get everything to work flawlessly.
