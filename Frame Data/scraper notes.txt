The SDMscraper.wsf script is a data scraper for the text files in the "DHS Data Sources" folder.
It collects that frame data and builds "DHS Frame Data.js" which is used by the DHS to generate frame data tables.
Those text files were originally created by SuperDoodleMan, but have been modified as described below.
Text files that haven't been renamed without the data portion have not yet been modified.

To use, run the .wsf in command line with cscript, like so:

"cscript scraper.wsf"

or use the initializer bats, e.g. "Initialize scraper.bat"



Changes made in each character specific files: 

    "Nicknames: " added to moves.
    Ground move and aerial names standardized. (made the same as what's in the selectionBox in the DHS, plus capitalization.)
    Standard names added to B moves (Down B, Up B, etc.)
    "Jab" move name given to grounded neutral a moves that do not chain (autocombo)
