Fire Attacks - this is a list of every fire attack in the game (and remember, fire melts ice, like Ice Climbers and especially Freezie's make, and that they can do to you, so if your foe is in ice DON'T use on of these attacks on him/her, but if your TEAMMATE is in ice, and "Friendly Fire" is on, then use one of these attacks to free him/her)
