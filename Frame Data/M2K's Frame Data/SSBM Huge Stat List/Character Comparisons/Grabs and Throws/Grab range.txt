5. Roy
6. Yoshi

8. Sheik
9. Zelda

Note: could be off some, due to characters moving back and
forth and where the attack is, like a higher up grab might
be more effective on Yoshi and Bowser because of the way they
hunch over for example, and how characters like Falco move
back and forth while standing still, so it's probably not
100% but at least pretty close.
