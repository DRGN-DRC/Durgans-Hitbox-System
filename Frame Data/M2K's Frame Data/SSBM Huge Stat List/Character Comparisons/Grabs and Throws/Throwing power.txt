Throwing Power - I made this list measuring the lowest damage
that a character(doesn't matter who, see whole paragraph for
details) needs for the crowd to cheer really loud from that
character being thrown. Note: For Mewtwo's forward throw I
measured both Pichu and Bowser when thrown, since the
screaming percentage doesn't stay the same with it. Normally,
THROWS(and ONLY throws) do not vary in screaming percentages.
In other words, throwing Bowser won't make it take longer AT
ALL then it would for the screaming percentage to occur than
it would for Pichu, it'd be at the SAME EXACT DAMAGE. Please
note, that this is ONLY for throws, and as for regular attacks
WEIGHT DOES MATTER! FALLING SPEED NEVER EVER EVER AFFECTS
SCREAMING PERCENTAGE, ONLY WEIGHT DOES). Try it with Bowser's
up smash on a light fast-faller like Fox, and then on a heavy
slow-faller like Samus, and even though Samus will be sent
farther than Fox will, the SCREAMING PERCENTAGE won't occur
for Samus until AFTER Fox's does. Anyway, here's the list of
screaming percentages for each throw.
