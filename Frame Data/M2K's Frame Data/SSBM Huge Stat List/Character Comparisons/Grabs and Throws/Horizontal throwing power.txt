Horizontal Throwing Power

This rates the relative power of every horizontal throw,
showing the lowest damage a Bowser, from starting position on
Yoshi's Island Past Stage (exact middle of top platform on the
stage) needs to have to be KO'd to the right side of the
stage, and the throwing character right next to Bowser on the
2nd to the right "respawn cloud"(where you go after you get
KO'd). This was done in Training Mode. More details explained
at very bottom. 

BTW, lower damage = stronger throw(KO's sooner)

Extra Info: 
---Ness, Link and Young Link's Forward Throw's throw all
characters (at the same damage) the same distance, regardless
of the character's weight. There might be a few more, but I
was tired of testing after the day of SSBM research was over
so I didn't fell like doing it. Maybe if some of you are bored
you can test it and post the ones not affected by weight here
in this topic.
---N/A means it kills at the top so I couldn't find it's
value, or it just doesn't KO, even at 999%.
---Bowser's Forward B throws are slightly weaker if you GRAB
the foe in air(it doesn't matter whether or not you throw them
in air, only if you GRAB them in air)
---Sometimes I drop directly to the platform below the
starting point to lower the altitude so Bowser won't get "star
KO'd" at the top of the screen so I can see the throw's
horizontal throwing power and sometimes I also use the bunny
hood with Bowser to make him fall faster so he won't die at
the top of the screen as much.
---Master/Crazy Hands throws are far more powerful than these
shown and tested, and I can't test Giga Bowser, who's a bit
stronger than Bowser in throw power.
---Some throws that can KO at the side but aren't technically
side throws, like DK's Carry and down throw and Marth/Roy's
down throw, and some that are sort of throws, like Bowser's
Forward B and Captain Falcon/Ganondorf's Up B, I still put
down since some consider them throws.
---Some moves which are the exact same in power, like Captain
Falcon and Ganondorf's back throw, vary slightly in damage
that Bowser get's KO'd at (For example, for Captain Falcon
it's 289% and for Ganondorf it's 288%) I still put at 289% and
288%, because it's still how far it knocked the character from
a standing position. It's only because Ganondorf's legs are
longer does he kill at 1 damage earlier than Captain Falcon,
because the release point is slightly closer to the stage's
"KO point", and it will still be like that in normal battle
anyway, so I still write down the exact lowest KO damage for
each throw for each character. However, some throws, that vary
by like 15-20%(or something close to that), and are almost the
same throw, like Falco and Fox's forward throw, do have
slightly different release points, but Falco has more KO power
in his forward throw than Fox regardless of the fact that he
has a SLIGHTLY farther release point in his throw.
---This test isn't going to be exact for the TRUE throw power,
because a lot of things are factors, such as the character,
stage length, and BY FAR most of all, POWER RANGE. An example
of Power Range is how a 30% Warlock Punch knocks sandbag
farther at 156%+ than a tip-hitting Warlock Punch does, but
normally (at 0% and anything lower than 156%) a tip-hit from
the Home Run Bat knocks Sandbag farther. This is a pretty big
distance for an average distance to the "KO-Point" in my test,
so another test with shorter distance to the KO-Point might
vary, but this is fairly highly accurate to give you a
relative idea on the powers of each throw so you know who you
should KO characters with.
