Grab + Attack Starting Speed - Measures the starting time of
each characters A attack while they're holding you(in a grab),
from fastest to slowest. BTW, on an interesting note, when
both Ice Climbers are present(and you press A really fast),
and for Mew2, Pichu, Pikachu, and Zelda, you stun a grabbed
character for 5 frames, where-as the other characters only
stun a foe for 3 frames. BTW, the total time for each grab
attack is EXACTLY 26 frames.

3 frames - Pichu / Pikachu

5 frames - Captain Falcon / Falco / Fox / Ganondorf

7 frames - Marth / Roy / Zelda
