This is for the lowest possible damage a "super move"
needs to be at to hit FARTHER than a tipper hit(in the
center of the platform of course)

Flare Blade(50% explosion one) - 20%+

Flare Blade(41%) - 28%+(potential to hit farther that
any other move except Roy's Counter and Mr. Game &
Watch's Oil Panic moves, even more than a 50% F.B., but
that's when the sandbag is at (approx.) 120%+)

Jigglypuff's Rest - 69%+

Pichu fully charged Skull Bash - 95%+

Bowser fully charged Forward Smash - 120%+

Mr. Game & Watch #9 Judgement - 138%+

Warlock Punch(30%) - 156%+

DK's fully charged Giant Punch - somewhere around 200%+

---Falcon Punch(27%, more KO power in air) - use only
this to hit sandbag, as C. Falcon's bat smash hits mainly
up and not very far horizontally.

---Peach's Bob-omb is very very rare(1/300?) so it's really
hard to measure the value at which it's stronger/weaker
than a HR Bat tipper hit, but at really high damages it's
stronger than a tipper hit.

--a no-ping hit is stronger than a tipper until around
120%+ where a tipper hit is stronger.

Note: most(about 2/3) of this "special moves that hit
farther than a HR bat tipper hit" was made my sdskeeto,
and some of the HRC damages I took from his FAQ(though I
did by far most of it)
