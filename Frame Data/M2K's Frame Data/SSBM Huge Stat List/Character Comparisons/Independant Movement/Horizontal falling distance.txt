Horizontal Aerial Falling Distance - this is how far a character can travel in the air over a certain amount of distance. It can be technically calculated with the formula: Horizontal Aerial Moving Speed <divided by> Falling Speed, but since we can't measure that in exact numbers, I had to do it by testing it with every character.
