Falling Speed - how fast characters fall, in their TOP speed (not to be confused with "falling speed ACCELERATION, which BTW Fox is the fastest in)

a ">" means that the character to the left of the ">" ACCELERATES to his/her top speed QUICKER than the foe to the right of the ">"

a "=" means the two or three characters between the "=" have the same acceleration.

Example: Sheik > Link = Young Link
this means that Sheik starts her fall quicker than Link and Young Link, and that Link starts his fall at the same exact speed as Young Link, but all 3 of those characters have the same top speed in a normal fall.

1) Falco
2) Captain Falcon
3) Fox***
4-5) Roy > DK
6) Marth
7-9) Sheik > Link = Young Link
10) Ganondorf
11) Yoshi
12-14) Bowser > Pichu = Pikachu
15) Ness
16-18) Dr. Mario = Mario = Mr. Game and Watch
19-21) Ice Climbers > Kirby > Luigi
22-23) Mewtwo > Peach
24-25) Samus > Zelda
26) Jigglypuff

***Fox may have the fastest acceleration in falling speed(that means when he starts to fall, he starts falling the quickest for the 1st 1/3 of a second or so) but Captain Falcon and Falco have a faster top speed in falling speed. Test it at Hyrule Temple on tiny melee if you don't believe me, and that's probably why there is so much arguments between who falls faster, Falco or Fox. Fox has quicker acceleration, but Falco(and also Captain Falcon) has a higher top speed.
