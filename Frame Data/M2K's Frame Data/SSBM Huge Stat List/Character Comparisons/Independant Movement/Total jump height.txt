Total Jumping Height - This measures how high characters can jump with all their jumps (and all 6 jumps for Kirby and Jigglypuff, INCLUDING air dodges, but NOT including wall jumps, special "Link's super jumps", and Mario's Mario Tornado and Dr. Mario's Dr. Tornado to gain extra height, because doing that is EXTREMELY hard to do to actually make any difference in a REAL match, becuase very very very few people have fingers THAT fast; not even me and I beat that really hard Star Fox Adventures game called "Test your Strength", which was NOT easy to beat, so that's why I'm not factoring that into the )
