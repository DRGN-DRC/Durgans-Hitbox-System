Wavedash List - (Wavedash is when you jump, and then the very INSTANT you're done the jump you air dodge down left or down right to slide and travel quickly and it's mostly of some use with characters with bad traction and ones that jump from the ground quickly (like Luigi, Ice Climbers, Mewtwo, and Marth, those are the main 4 to wavedash with). This is about 95% or more accurate, because it's REALLY, REALLY, REALLY hard to get an EXACT ranking near the middle-bottom of the list, because the difference is so little, and besides, who cares if it's exactly 100%correct near the bottom of the list because nobody's really going to want to wavedash if it's that bad for certain characters anyway)

---note, characters that take a while to jump into the air, like Bowser for instance, won't be able to start their wavedash as quickly as fast jumpers, like Sheik and Fox. HOWEVER, this wavedash list ONLY measures how far they slide in a wavedash, and THAT'S ALL.
