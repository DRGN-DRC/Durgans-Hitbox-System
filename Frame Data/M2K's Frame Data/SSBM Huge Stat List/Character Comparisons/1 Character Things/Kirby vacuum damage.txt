Damage Kirby's Vacuum attack does when Kirby spits his
foe out with the "A" button - Depending on which
character Kirby spits out, if the star hits a foe it can
do anywhere between 9-19%(not 11% though). Usually the
star does more % to any unlucky foe who gets hit by it
if the character Kirby's spitting out is big and/or
heavy (for some exceptions like with Fox and Falco, who
are relatively small for their power). 

---Side note, characters on Giant Melee and/or with a
Super Mushroom do more damage than normal-sized
characters do, and characters on Tiny Melee and/or with
a Poison Mushroom do less damage than normal-sized
characters do.
