Egg Size List - This (sadly) almost useless list is how
big the APPEARANCE of various characters are in Yoshi's
Egg (from Yoshi's B move). Sadly, near when I was
finished, I found out that this doesn't matter even 1%
since the appearance is different than the actual spot
where the trapped-in-an-egg-character gets hit, like
Link gets hit at a slightly higher point than Falco, and
Link is slightly smaller in Yoshi's egg. Oh well, it's
pretty accurate to the hit-able size in the egg, and at
least 100% accurate on the appearance of the egg, while
it might only be 90% accurate in terms of the actual
"invisible" target size outside it. Here's the list from
biggest to smallest (even though the smaller the egg,
the better for the victim trapped inside the egg, since
you're a smaller target)

1) Bowser
2) DK
3-4) Ganondorf / Mewtwo
5-9) Captain Falcon / Marth / Roy / Samus / Yoshi
10) Falco
11) Link
12-15) Ice Climbers / Mr. Game & Watch / Peach / Zelda
16-20) Dr. Mario / Luigi / Mario / Ness / Sheik
21-22) Fox / Young Link
23) Jigglypuff
24-25) Kirby / Pikachu
26) Pichu
