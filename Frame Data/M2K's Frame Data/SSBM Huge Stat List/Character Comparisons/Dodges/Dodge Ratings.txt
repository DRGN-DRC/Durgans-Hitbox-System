Dodge Ratings - Here's a list I made of everyone's dodge ratings,
statistically proven with frames counts on the frames of the dodge
that you're ALWAYS invincible to ALL attacks. The number on the left
half of the fraction is the amount of frames you're actually dodging
(in other words, how many frames you're invincible and can't be
harmed) while the number on the right half of the fraction is the
total time that the dodge lasts. The percent of the dodge that you're
ALWAYS invincible is written in a percent, and a ..... means it's a
repeating decimal. Note: almost all of the dodges start on frame 2,
so in other words, for most of the dodges when you start them, you
can only be hit the FIRST frame of the dodge. Some characters, like
Captain Falcon, start their dodge on the 3rd frame, and Bowser starts
his on the 4th frame. Here's the dodge ratings list, from best to
worst.
