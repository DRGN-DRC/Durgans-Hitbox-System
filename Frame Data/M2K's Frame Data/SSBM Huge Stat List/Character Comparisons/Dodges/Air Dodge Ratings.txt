Air Dodge Ratings - measures the amount of frames you're ALWAYS
invincible to ALL attacks when you dodge in air, from best to
worst.

---BTW, for projectile attacks, Peach/Zelda dodge them longer
than anyone(and 1 frame earlier than normal too), then the next
best is Marth/Roy, then Falco/Fox, and then a tie for worst/normal
is for the rest of the characters, who don't dodge extra long
for projectiles as for normal attacks(too bad for them). Also,
starting time is the amount of frames that the characters CAN be
harmed, so for example a starting time of 2 frames means you're
INVINCIBLE from frames 3 and up).

Also note that there are other factors as well, which include the
fact that certain characters, like Mewtwo for example, "recover"
from his dodge extremely fast. What I mean by this is that after
he finished his air dodge, he can grab the ledge(if he's next to
one) almost right away, while other characters, like
Zelda/Peach/Fox/Falco/etc.etc.etc. don't grab the ledge right
away, so they can't use it for recovering off the stage as easily
as Mewtwo can. There's also how long the air dodge keeps them in
air, like how Zelda/Peach's is MUCH quicker than the other
characters, as when those 2 proncesses air dodge they fall back
down to the ground almost right away(I bet you didn't know that
Zelda's Air Dodge goes FARTHER/HIGHER than Zelda's aerial jump)
