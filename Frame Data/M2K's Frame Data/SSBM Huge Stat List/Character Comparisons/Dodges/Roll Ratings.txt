Roll Ratings - measures how long a character is
invincible during his/her roll, kind of like it
is on the dodge ratings list, ranking a roll's
rating by the percentage of the roll that you're
invincible to ALL attack. (BTW, every decimal in
the percentages are ALL repeating decimals, so I
didn't bother to put a line over it or ..... to
signify that it's a repeating decimal, because
by coincidence ALL of the decimals are repeating
decimals).

*Almost every roll has a starting time of 3
frames (so you CAN be hit on frames 1, 2, and 3,
but you CAN'T be hit on 4, 5, 6, etc.)

***Jigglypuff's FORWARD roll has a quick starting
time of 2 frames, but it has the same TOTAL TIME
as her BACK roll because the FORWARD roll ends
"invincible time" (near the end of the roll) 1
frame before her BACK roll does. Coincidentially
the total time is the same though.

*****Bowser's rolls have a starting time of 4
frames (so you CAN be hit frames 1, 2, 3, and 4
but you CAN'T be hit frames 5, 6, 7, etc.)
