Super Smash Brothers Melee

Before I go on with this list, I want to tell you that a FRAME is 1/60 of a second in this game, so for example something 15 frames means it takes 1/4 of a second to execute, like Mewtwo's Down B (Disable) or Samus's Charge Shot(at fastest, or when already fully charged), or Mr. Game & Watch's Down Smash(uncharged), and Sheik's aerial down A, which all takes 15 frames to execute. Also, Nana's reaction time to Popo's (the two Ice Climbers) movements and actions are EXACTLY 6 frames after Popo(blue, boy, human, leader Ice Climber), or 0.1 or 1/10 of a second.

Here's some common frames to seconds "translations":
60 frames = 1 second
30 frames = 1/2 second
20 frames = 1/3 second
15 frames = 1/4 second
12 frames = 1/5 second
10 frames = 1/6 second
etc. etc. etc.
