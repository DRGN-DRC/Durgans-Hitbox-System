I'm glad you've decided to try this (hopefully) easy to use

organized version of Jason Zimmerman's popular HUGE SSBM

statistics list.



I had absolutely no part in creating/discovering any of the

info contained herein. I just copied and pasted each section

into a seperate text files. The Table of Contents is only

still included to serve as a list of the various lists here, in

case people don't want to go looking through folders to see

what all there is. Jason Zimmerman (Mew2King on SWF) and

various other contributors are to thank. Jason's webpage, which

has similar lists for other games, can be found at

The Smashboards topic containing (most? all?) of the list also, is at

http://www.smashboards.com/showthread.php?s=f8e97531fa88e2fb24a971582658f3db&threadid=30064

It's updated, so maybe you should check there in case he's done

some other stuff since now, which is 6/23/2004. I won't be

updating this collection, because I'm too lazy. I might seem to

have spent a lot of time compiling this, but it's only to save

time in the future for myself and others. That's right, I can

be altruistically lazy. Deal with it.
